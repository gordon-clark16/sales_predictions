# Sales Analysis to Predict Future Trends
-This is a mock data exploration and analysis with visualizations designed to assist a retailer understand the properties of products and which of those properties influence overall sales of that product.  

-The data has 12 unique columns with 8523 entries.  After cleaning, the data was explored with visuals to include boxplots, histograms, and heatmaps.

-Finally, explanatory visuals were created with the intention of delivering a message to the retailer.  These visuals included barplots and scatterplots.

-With these visuals, we found that Maximum Retail Price(MRP) was the primary driver of the sales an item brings in.  However, these sales were very dependent on the type of outlet the item was sold in.  Grocery stores delivered lower sales regardless of MRP, while Supermarket type 3 delivered higher sales across all MRP.  Unexpectedly, the data showed no correlation between the shelf space alloted to an item and the sales of that item.
