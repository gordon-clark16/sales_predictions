# Sales Analysis to Predict Future Trends
-This is a mock data exploration and analysis with visualizations designed to assist a retailer understand the properties of products and which of those properties influence overall sales of that product.  

-The data has 12 unique columns with 8523 entries.  After cleaning, the data was explored with visuals to include boxplots, histograms, and heatmaps.

-After the exploration, explanatory visuals were created with the intention of delivering a message to the retailer.  These visuals included barplots and scatterplots.

-With these visuals, we found that Maximum Retail Price(MRP) was the primary driver of the sales an item brings in.  However, these sales were very dependent on the type of outlet the item was sold in.  Grocery stores delivered lower sales regardless of MRP, while Supermarket type 3 delivered higher sales across all MRP.  Unexpectedly, the data showed no correlation between the shelf space alloted to an item and the sales of that item.

Finally, we used the cleaned data to create several regression models in an attempt to predict Item Sales.  While none of our models were accurate enough to utilize for predictions, the exploration used for cleaning and visualizing the data provided the key insights listed above that can still be used to maximize sales of future items.

With these insights, we are able to provide the following recommendations: increasing MRP (within reason) will increase Item Sales, avoid selling in grocery stores to increase sales, target selling in Supermarket Type 3 for the highest potential Item Sales, and further research is required before further investing in increased shelf space for an item.
